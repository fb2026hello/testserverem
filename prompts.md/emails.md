EMAIL 1-A: The "Engineer's Intro" (Balanced & Professional)
Subject: Open Source hardware + 3d printer enclosure = better and safer printing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Fabrizio. I'm an aerospace engineering student with a desire to help the open source community.

So, you might be asking yourself: Why am I writing to you?

I am writing to share a solution to a problem that many makers don't consider enough until it's too late: Air Quality.

[clura image: Hero shot of the enclosure]

**What did I build?**
I built Clura, the best completely open-source enclosure ecosystem featuring air filtration, environmental sensors, and more.

I started this project because I wanted to print in my room without destroying my lungs (3D Printing releases VOCs and particulates in the air). I wanted an affordable, feature-packed enclosure that could be adapted to any printer. None existed, so I made my own.

**Why am I writing to you?**
I'm here to just share with you the solution to a problem which I think many makers don't consider enough. I thought that you might want to check out our github repo which contains everything we have ever made and our documentation page.

We are also launching on Kickstarter soon and if you wanted to support the project you could get the enclosure kit at a discounted price.

**Want to learn more? Here is what Clura can do:**

* **Feature 1 - Active Air Filtration:** Real HEPA/Carbon scrubbing to remove VOCs.
* **Feature 2 - Filament Weight Sensing:** Know exactly how much material you have left.
* **Feature 3 - Smart Ecosystem:** A touch screen + sensors to monitor your print environment.

Best,
Fabrizio

EMAIL 1-B: The "No Fluff" (Blunt, Detailed, & Honest)
Subject: Open source hardware + Aerospace eng. student = Awesome 3d printer enclosure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Fabrizio.

I know you must receive a lot of emails like this—people trying to hype up their products to get a pledge.

To be honest, I initially did not want to send this. I felt that it made our project look like all of these "companies" just trying to sell you something. **But we're different.** Everything I have ever made is open source and available on my github.

I have spent the last 18 months of my life working on this project as an aerospace engineering student. My goal isn't just to sell units; it is to help as many makers as possible safeguard their health when 3d printing.

**This is Clura:**
It is a fully open-source hardware ecosystem designed to make printing safer and smarter.

[clura image: Technical exploded view or internal components]

Unlike generic acrylic boxes, Clura is an engineered system involving:
* **Smart Sensing:** Integrated environmental sensors (VOC, PM2.5, Temp/Humidity) running on custom open firmware.
* **Active Filtration:** Not just a fan, but a scrubbing loop designed to actually trap harmful particles.
* **Filament Intelligence:** A built-in load cell system that tracks filament usage by weight, so you never start a print you can't finish.
* **Modularity:** It’s built on standard profiles and printable parts, meaning you can adapt it to a Prusa, an Ender, or a custom rig.

**Here is the deal:**
I don't care if you choose to self-source the components following our Bill of Materials and our extensive guides, or if you buy our kit to support us.

All I care is that I have helped another maker with something that I care deeply about. I wanted to give you this option.

If you want to build it yourself, grab the files here:

I hope this helps your setup.

EMAIL 1-C: The "Maker's Wish" (Open Source Focus)
Subject: The 3d printer enclosure I wished someone built (Open Source & Affordable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Fabrizio.

I'm an aerospace engineering student, but really, I'm just a maker who got tired of proprietary hardware.

I wanted to print safely in my room, but the only good enclosures on the market were closed-source, expensive, and unmodifiable. The cheap ones were just fire hazards.

**I wished someone had built a high-quality, open-source ecosystem.** No one did, so I spent the last 18 months building it myself.

[clura image: Shot of the enclosure open showing the printer inside]

**Meet Clura.**
Clura is built on the philosophy that you should own your hardware.
* **100% Open Source:** Every STL, PCB design, and line of code is available.
* **Community Driven:** Designed to be hacked, modified, and improved by you.
* **Health First:** Professional-grade air filtration to stop VOCs and micro-plastics from damaging your lungs.

We are launching on Kickstarter to get these kits into the hands of makers, but the source code is live right now.

If you believe in open hardware that actually protects your health, check us out.

EMAIL 2-A: The "Fellow Maker" (Friendly & Accessible)
Subject: Open Source hardware + 3d printer enclosure = better and safer printing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! I'm Fabrizio.

I'm an aerospace engineering student, but mostly I'm just a guy who loves 3D printing and tinkering with open source tech.

I'm writing to you because, like you, I spend a lot of time around my printer. But there was always one thing that bugged me: the fumes.

[clura image: Hero shot of Clura looking sleek]

**So, what did I build?**
I built **Clura**. It’s the enclosure I always wanted but couldn't buy. It’s affordable, completely open-source, and it actually keeps the air in your workshop clean.

I started this project because I wanted to print in my bedroom without destroying my lungs with VOCs and particulates. Since nothing good existed, I decided to DIY the ultimate solution.

**Why check it out?**
I figured since you follow 3D printing pages, you might dig this. I'm just here to share a solution to a problem we all have.

We have a Github repo with all our files, and a documentation page if you want to see how it works. We are also launching on Kickstarter soon, so if you want to grab a kit for your setup, now is the time to look.

<Button href="https://github.com/Cluradev/CluraEnclosure">Check the Github</Button>
<Button href="https://clura.dev">Want to learn more? Visit clura.dev</Button>

**What can Clura actually do for you?**
* **Air Filtration:** Filters the nasty stuff so you breathe easy.
* **Filament Scale:** Tells you exactly how much plastic you have left.
* **Smart Screen:** Controls your printer's environment with a touch interface.

Cheers,
Fabrizio

EMAIL 2-B: The "Prusa/Cost Story" (Problem & Solution)
Subject: The Ultimate 3d printer enclosure for your Prusa MK3/4 & Prusa Mini
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Fabrizio.

A while back, I was looking for an enclosure for my Prusa. I saw the main options on the market costing nearly €500 when picked out with some features.

**I didn't want to spend €500 on a box.**

Especially one that didn't even have smart sensors. I felt I could do better—create something affordable that wasn't just "a box," but a whole ecosystem for my printer.

[clura image: Clura setup with a Prusa printer inside]

**So I built Clura.**
It’s an upgrade for your entire printing experience. It’s not just about saving money; it’s about getting more features than the expensive industrial options:

1.  **Safety:** It uses active air circulation through HEPA/Carbon filters to scrub VOCs (essential if you print indoors).
2.  **Smarts:** It includes a smart screen that tracks temperature, humidity, and air quality in real-time.
3.  **Filament Tracking:** It weighs your spool as you print, so you never fail a print due to running out of material.

I'm launching this project soon to help other makers upgrade their setup without the crazy price tag.

Don't settle for overpriced gear. Build better.

EMAIL 2-C: The "Health Education" (Educational & Story)
Subject: Do you 3d print? This could save your lungs. An open source 3d printer enclosure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Fabrizio.

We all love 3D printing, but we rarely talk about the invisible cost: **Air Quality.**

When you melt plastic—even standard PLA—it releases VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) and ultrafine particles. If you print in your bedroom or home office like I do, you are breathing this in for hours every day.

I realized this 18 months ago, and I refused to stop printing. So I used my background in aerospace engineering to build a solution.

[clura image: Diagram of air flow or filter system]

**I built Clura: An Open Source Enclosure.**
I designed this specifically to scrub the air and keep your environment safe, without breaking the bank.

I actually wrote a detailed guide on the health effects of 3D printing and how to mitigate them.

<Button href="https://www.clura.dev/en/blog/air-quality">Read the Article: Air Quality & 3D Printing</Button>

**What is Clura?**
It is the enclosure I built to solve this problem.
* It has **Smart Sensors** to detect pollution.
* It has **Active Filtration** to clean the air.

Check out the blog to learn more about the health side, and if you like the project, you can sign up on the site to get notified when we launch.

Stay safe,
Fabrizio
