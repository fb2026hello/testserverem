I'm the owner of clura, the 3d printer enclosure brand that is launching soon on KS and i am organizing my email marketnig strategy.



I have 2 types of people i will be emailing:

Users from instagram that follow pages of similar industries

Kickstarter superbackers



I am creating a strategy for these two groups targeted at sending the these two emails with different version



Your goal is to create polished and finished version of the emails below. There is one email for each category and 3 versions for each email. So 6 polished and finished ready to send emails. Include picture tags and link tags as if each one was an email.tsx file.



-----------------------------

Emails for superbackers (a,b,c versions) - goal is kickstarter page follow



A) 

Subject: Open Source hardware + 3d printer enclosure = better and safer printing

Content: 

-short intro: Hi, I'm Fabrizio, an aerospace engineering with a desire to help the open source community. So, you might be asking yourself what did I do and why am i writing to you?

-what did i built: 

I built Clura, the best completely open source enclosure which has air filtration, environmental sensors and more. 



I started this project because i wanted to print in my room without destroying my lungs (3D Printing releases VOCs and particulates in the air). I wanted an affordable, feature-packed enclosure that could be adapted to any printer. None existed, so I made my own.







-why am i writing to you? 

I'm here to just share with you the solution to a problem which i think many makers don't consider enough. I thought that you might want to check out our github repo which contains everything we have ever made and our documentation page. We are also launching on kickstarter soon and if you wanted to support the project you could get the enclosure kit at a discounted price

Feature 1 - Air filtration



Feature 2 - filament weight sensing



Feauture 3 - smart screen + sensors



B)

Subject: Open source hardware + Aerospace eng. student = Awesome 3d printer enclosure



modified content of version a. Make it very blunt. Say: i know you must receive a lot of emails like this, people trying to show you their products. I initially did not want to do this, because i felt that it made our project look like all of these companies, but we're different. I want to help out as many makers as possible to saveguard their health, and our enclosure is an awesome way to do it. I don't care if you choose to self source the components following our bill pf materials and our extensive guides or if you buy our kit to support us. All i care is that i have helped another maker with something that i care deeply about.



I have spent 1.5 years of my life working on this project, and i wanted to give you this.



Keep below info about clura



C)

Subject: The 3d printer enclosure i wished someone built. Open source and affordable



same as version a, maybe more focused on the enclosures and the printers

B)

Subject: The Ultimate 3d printer enclosure for your Prusa mk3/4 & prusa mini

Content: same as A, but use as a story section more that you did not want to spend 500 euros on the main enclosure that was on the market because it was too expensive and without enough features. You felt you could do better and create a whole ecosystem around this.



C)

Subject: Do you 3d print? This could save your lungs. An open source 3d printer enclosure

Content: explain the story as version A and B, but be shorter, explain a lot more the health effects, go in detail. Then say that to learn more they can read the blog on our website: https://www.clura.dev/en/blog/air-quality



Still explain the product and what i built / my backstory
